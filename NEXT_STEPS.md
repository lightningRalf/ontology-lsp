# Ontology LSP - Project Status & Next Steps

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. **LSP Server (MIGRATED TO BUN & WORKING)**
- ✅ Built with Bun and running (`dist/server.js`)
- ✅ Using Bun's native SQLite (no more native module conflicts!)
- ✅ Multi-layer architecture (Claude Tools → Tree-sitter → Ontology → Patterns → Propagation)
- ✅ Support for TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python
- ✅ **All server tests passing (20/20 tests pass with Bun test)**
- ✅ Server runs with `just start` or `~/.bun/bin/bun run dist/server.js --stdio`
- ✅ Bundle size: 1MB (fully self-contained)
- ✅ Fixed all import issues and module instantiation problems

### 2. **VS Code Extension (BUN-COMPATIBLE & READY)**
- ✅ **Extension compiles successfully** with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ **Extension packages successfully** as `ontology-lsp-1.0.0.vsix` (681 KB)
- ✅ **Extension configured to use Bun runtime** for server execution
- ✅ **Fixed all native module issues** - Bun's SQLite is built-in
- ✅ **Fixed activation events** - added `onStartupFinished` for reliable activation
- ✅ **Optimized performance settings** - lowered CPU usage (workers: 2, cache: 250MB)
- ✅ Comprehensive extension with all modules:
  - Core extension with LanguageClient
  - Configuration management
  - Status bar UI
  - Security layer (filters sensitive data)
  - Performance monitoring
  - Command system (12 commands)
  - Team collaboration features
  - Extension API for third-party integration
  - Webview for concept graph visualization

### 3. **Build System (POWERED BY BUN)**
- ✅ Justfile updated for Bun commands with full paths
- ✅ Build time: ~50ms with Bun bundler
- ✅ Using Biome instead of ESLint for linting
- ✅ Tree-sitter packages trusted and working with Bun
- ✅ `just` commands: build, test, test-unit, test-integration, test-coverage, test-watch, package, install

### 4. **Technology Stack**
- ✅ **Runtime:** Bun v1.2.20 (replacing Node.js)
- ✅ **Database:** Bun's native SQLite (replacing better-sqlite3)
- ✅ **Linter:** Biome (replacing ESLint)
- ✅ **Bundler:** Bun's built-in bundler
- ✅ **Language Parsers:** Tree-sitter with trusted dependencies

## 🚀 Latest Updates (CURRENT SESSION - Aug 22, 2025)

### 1. **Migrated to Bun Runtime** ✅
Complete migration from Node.js to Bun:
- Replaced better-sqlite3 with Bun's native SQLite
- No more NODE_MODULE_VERSION conflicts

### 3. **Improved Developer Experience** ✅
Better tooling and performance:
- Biome for faster linting (replacing ESLint)
- 50ms build times with Bun
- Single 1MB bundle for the server
- Simplified dependency management

### 4. **CLI Tool Created** ✅
Full-featured command-line interface:
- `ontology-lsp init` - Initialize project configuration
- `ontology-lsp start` - Start LSP server (stdio/port modes)
- `ontology-lsp analyze` - Analyze codebase
- `ontology-lsp stats` - Show statistics
- `ontology-lsp find` - Find identifiers with fuzzy matching
- `ontology-lsp suggest` - Get refactoring suggestions

### 5. **Enhanced Testing** ✅
Comprehensive test coverage:
- **Migrated from Jest to Bun test** for faster execution
- Integration tests for LSP server
- Performance benchmarks
- Cache hit rate testing
- Concurrent operations testing
- Large file handling tests
- **All 20 tests passing** with Bun test runner

### 6. **Test Migration to Bun** ✅
Complete testing infrastructure overhaul:

- Updated all test files to use `bun:test` imports
- Fixed import issues (ASTNode from types/core)
- Updated Justfile with Bun test commands
- Added test:watch and test:coverage scripts
- CI/CD updated to use Bun test

### 7. **Bug Fixes** ✅
Critical issues resolved:
- Fixed ASTNode import path in concept-builder
- Removed problematic re-export from tree-sitter layer
- Fixed server instantiation (only runs as main module)
- Updated integration tests to not instantiate server directly
- Added full Bun paths to all build scripts

### 8. **MCP Server - NEEDS FIXING** 🔴
Started redesigning MCP integration but discovered missing endpoints:

**Problems Found**:
- CLI expects `/find` endpoint but HTTP server doesn't have it
- CLI expects endpoints that don't exist in the API server
- MCP server has broken imports (`@ontology/layers/claude-tools.js`)
- Architecture mismatch between what CLI expects and what API provides

**TODO - Fix These Issues**:
1. **Add missing endpoints to HTTP server** (`src/api/http-server.ts`):
   - `/find` - for finding identifiers
   - Verify all CLI commands have matching API endpoints
   
2. **Fix the CLI client** (`src/cli/index.ts`):
   - Map CLI commands to actual existing API endpoints
   - Or update API to have the endpoints CLI expects
   
3. **Complete MCP integration**:
   - Fix imports in `mcp-ontology-server/src/layers/`
   - Test the CLI → API flow actually works
   - Ensure MCP can spawn CLI commands successfully

4. **Add start/stop scripts** (mentioned but not implemented):
   - Create script to start LSP server in background
   - Create script to stop running LSP server
   - Add health check to verify server is running

**Current Status**: 🔴 BROKEN - CLI calls endpoints that don't exist

## 📋 Testing Steps (TO DO NOW)

### Step 1: Install and Test the Fixed Extension
```bash
# Quick install with our script
./install-extension.sh

# Or manually:
code --uninstall-extension ontology-team.ontology-lsp
code --install-extension vscode-client/ontology-lsp-1.0.0.vsix
```

### Step 2: Verify Extension is Working
1. **Restart VS Code**: Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"
2. **Open a TypeScript/JavaScript file** in the test-workspace folder
3. **Check extension activated**: View → Output → Select "Ontology Language Server"
4. **Verify commands available**: Ctrl+Shift+P → Type "Ontology" (should see commands)
5. **Check status bar**: Should show "Ontology LSP" indicator

### Step 3: Debug if Needed
```bash
# Check if extension is installed
code --list-extensions | grep ontology

# Verify server runs standalone
node dist/server.js --stdio

# Check Developer Console for errors
# Help → Toggle Developer Tools → Console

# Check Extension Host logs
# View → Output → Select "Extension Host"
```

### Step 4: Test LSP Features
1. **Hover**: Hover over a function/variable
2. **Go to Definition**: F12 on a symbol
3. **Find References**: Shift+F12 on a symbol
4. **Rename**: F2 on a symbol
5. **Code Actions**: Ctrl+. on highlighted code
6. **Completions**: Start typing and check suggestions

### Step 5: Verify Performance
The extension should now use less resources:
- Workers: 2 (was 4)
- Cache: 250MB (was 500MB)
- Propagation depth: 2 (was 3)

Monitor in the Ontology status bar or performance panel.

## 🔧 Quick Fixes to Try Next Session

### Fix 1: Force Activation (Easiest)
```json
// In vscode-client/package.json
"activationEvents": ["*"]  // Always activate
```

### Fix 2: Absolute Server Path
```json
// In VS Code settings.json
{
  "ontologyLSP.server.path": "/home/lightningralf/programming/ontology-lsp/dist/server.js"
}
```

### Fix 3: Debug Mode
```bash
# Run extension in debug mode
cd vscode-client
code .
# Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
```

### Fix 4: Check VS Code Version
```bash
# VS Code OSS might be the issue
# Try regular VS Code if available
code --version  # vs  code-oss --version
```

## 💡 Root Cause Analysis

**Why it's not working:**
1. **VS Code OSS** vs regular VS Code - different extension paths
2. **Activation events** not triggering - extension never starts
3. **Server path** resolution - relative path calculation wrong
4. **Missing error handling** - extension fails silently

**The solution path:**
1. First get extension to activate (even with `"*"`)
2. Then fix server path (absolute path works)
3. Then optimize activation events
4. Finally add proper error messages

## 🔧 MCP Server - TODO: Complete the Integration

The MCP integration was partially implemented but needs these fixes:

### **Planned Architecture: CLI as the Foundation**
```
Claude Code → MCP Server → CLI Commands → HTTP API → LSP Server
```

### **Critical Architecture Issue - 5-Layer System Not Connected**:

The MCP server needs to implement the **5-layer architecture** where each layer progressively enhances results:

1. **Layer 1 (Claude Tools)**: Uses Glob/Grep/LS for fast search (~5ms)
2. **Layer 2 (Tree-sitter)**: AST analysis from LSP server (~50ms)  
3. **Layer 3 (Ontology)**: Concept relationships from LSP (~10ms)
4. **Layer 4 (Pattern Learner)**: Learned patterns from LSP (~10ms)
5. **Layer 5 (Knowledge Spreader)**: Change propagation (~20ms)

**The Problem**: MCP server needs **bidirectional communication**:
- MCP → Claude Code's Glob/Grep/LS tools (for Layer 1)
- MCP → LSP server (for Layers 2-5: tree-sitter, ontology, patterns)

**Example Flow for `find_definition`**:
1. Layer 1: Try with Claude's Grep tool (fast regex search)
2. If insufficient → Layer 2: Get AST from LSP's tree-sitter
3. If needed → Layer 3: Query ontology relationships from LSP
4. Continue through layers as needed

### **What Still Needs to be Done**:

1. **Fix the Bidirectional Communication**:
   - MCP server needs way to call Claude Code's Glob/Grep/LS tools
   - MCP server needs to connect to running LSP server (not create own instances)
   - Options: Tool injection, callback mechanism, or shared process

2. **Fix API Endpoints Mismatch**:
   - CLI calls `/find` but API doesn't have this endpoint
   - Need to either add `/find` to API or update CLI to use existing endpoints
   - Verify all CLI commands map to actual API endpoints

3. **Fix MCP Server Imports**:
   - Broken: `@ontology/layers/claude-tools.js` doesn't exist
   - Need to fix all import paths in `mcp-ontology-server/src/layers/`
   - Connect layers to actual LSP server, not standalone implementations

4. **Test the Full Flow**:
   - Start API server: `ontology-lsp api` 
   - Test CLI commands actually work with `--json` flag
   - Test MCP server can spawn CLI and get results
   - Test 5-layer progressive enhancement actually works

5. **Create Helper Scripts**:
   - `start-lsp-server.sh` - Start server in background
   - `stop-lsp-server.sh` - Stop running server
   - Add to package.json scripts

6. **Documentation**:
   - Document which endpoints exist vs which are needed
   - Create mapping table: CLI command → API endpoint
   - Document how layers communicate with Claude tools and LSP
   - Add troubleshooting guide
