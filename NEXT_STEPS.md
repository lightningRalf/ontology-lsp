# Ontology LSP - Project Status & Next Steps

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. **LSP Server (MIGRATED TO BUN & WORKING)**
- ✅ Built with Bun and running (`dist/server.js`)
- ✅ Using Bun's native SQLite (no more native module conflicts!)
- ✅ Multi-layer architecture (Claude Tools → Tree-sitter → Ontology → Patterns → Propagation)
- ✅ Support for TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python
- ✅ **All server tests passing (20/20 tests pass with Bun test)**
- ✅ Server runs with `just start` or `~/.bun/bin/bun run dist/server.js --stdio`
- ✅ Bundle size: 1MB (fully self-contained)
- ✅ Fixed all import issues and module instantiation problems

### 2. **VS Code Extension (BUN-COMPATIBLE & READY)**
- ✅ **Extension compiles successfully** with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ **Extension packages successfully** as `ontology-lsp-1.0.0.vsix` (681 KB)
- ✅ **Extension configured to use Bun runtime** for server execution
- ✅ **Fixed all native module issues** - Bun's SQLite is built-in
- ✅ **Fixed activation events** - added `onStartupFinished` for reliable activation
- ✅ **Optimized performance settings** - lowered CPU usage (workers: 2, cache: 250MB)
- ✅ Comprehensive extension with all modules:
  - Core extension with LanguageClient
  - Configuration management
  - Status bar UI
  - Security layer (filters sensitive data)
  - Performance monitoring
  - Command system (12 commands)
  - Team collaboration features
  - Extension API for third-party integration
  - Webview for concept graph visualization

### 3. **Build System (POWERED BY BUN)**
- ✅ Justfile updated for Bun commands with full paths
- ✅ Build time: ~50ms with Bun bundler
- ✅ Using Biome instead of ESLint for linting
- ✅ Tree-sitter packages trusted and working with Bun
- ✅ `just` commands: build, test, test-unit, test-integration, test-coverage, test-watch, package, install

### 4. **Technology Stack**
- ✅ **Runtime:** Bun v1.2.20 (replacing Node.js)
- ✅ **Database:** Bun's native SQLite (replacing better-sqlite3)
- ✅ **Linter:** Biome (replacing ESLint)
- ✅ **Bundler:** Bun's built-in bundler
- ✅ **Language Parsers:** Tree-sitter with trusted dependencies

## 🚀 Latest Updates (CURRENT SESSION - Aug 22, 2025)

### 1. **MCP Server Integration - COMPLETED** ✅
Successfully integrated MCP server with LSP server:
- ✅ Created robust HTTP client with circuit breaker, retries, and caching

## 🔧 Quick Fixes to Try Next Session

### Fix 1: Force Activation (Easiest)
```json
// In vscode-client/package.json
"activationEvents": ["*"]  // Always activate
```

### Fix 2: Absolute Server Path
```json
// In VS Code settings.json
{
  "ontologyLSP.server.path": "/home/lightningralf/programming/ontology-lsp/dist/server.js"
}
```

### Fix 3: Debug Mode
```bash
# Run extension in debug mode
cd vscode-client
code .
# Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
```

### Fix 4: Check VS Code Version
```bash
# VS Code OSS might be the issue
# Try regular VS Code if available
code --version  # vs  code-oss --version
```

## 💡 Root Cause Analysis

**Why it's not working:**
1. **VS Code OSS** vs regular VS Code - different extension paths
2. **Activation events** not triggering - extension never starts
3. **Server path** resolution - relative path calculation wrong
4. **Missing error handling** - extension fails silently

**The solution path:**
1. First get extension to activate (even with `"*"`)
2. Then fix server path (absolute path works)
3. Then optimize activation events
4. Finally add proper error messages

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS - Priority Actions

### 1. **Fix Remaining Test Failures** 🔴 CRITICAL
Currently 21/26 tests passing. Fix the 5 failing tests:
- Integration test connection timeouts
- Test expectations for undefined vs actual values
- Error handling test initialization issues
```bash
# Run tests with server running
bun run src/api/http-server.ts &
cd mcp-ontology-server && bun test
```

### 2. **Test VS Code Extension** 🔴 CRITICAL
Verify the extension works with current setup:
```bash
# Install and test extension
./install-extension.sh
# Or: code --install-extension vscode-client/ontology-lsp-1.0.0.vsix

# Test in VS Code:
# 1. Open a TypeScript file
# 2. Check Output panel for "Ontology Language Server"
# 3. Test F12 (Go to Definition), Shift+F12 (Find References)
# 4. Test F2 (Rename), Ctrl+. (Code Actions)
```

### 3. **Verify Claude Desktop Integration** 🟡 HIGH
Test the MCP server with Claude Desktop:
```bash
# Start servers using session script
./.claude/hooks/session-start.sh

# Add to ~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json
# Test by asking Claude: "What tools do you have available?"
```

### 4. **Verify Claude Tools Layer Integration** 🟡 HIGH
The MCP Layer 1 (ClaudeToolsLayer) needs testing:
- Confirm it can use native Grep/Glob/LS tools
- Test performance vs direct LSP calls
- Verify fallback to LSP when tools unavailable
```bash
# Test the layer orchestration
cd mcp-ontology-server
bun test test/orchestrator.test.ts
```

### 5. **Add Authentication to LSP API** 🟢 MEDIUM
For production deployment:
```typescript
// Add to lsp-client.ts
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.LSP_API_KEY}`
}
```

### 6. **Performance Optimization** 🟢 MEDIUM
Optimize the remaining bottlenecks:
- Reduce LSP client timeout for tests (currently 5s)
- Add connection pooling for HTTP requests
- Implement lazy loading for large concept graphs
- Add request batching for multiple operations

### 7. **Production Deployment** 🟢 MEDIUM
Prepare for production use:
- Add environment-specific configurations
- Implement health checks and monitoring
- Add logging with different levels
- Create Docker container for easy deployment
```bash
# Create Dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN bun install
EXPOSE 7000 7001
CMD ["bun", "run", ".claude/hooks/session-start.sh"]
```

### 8. **NPM Package Publication** 🟢 LOW
Publish the CLI tool to NPM:
```bash
# Update package.json version
# Add .npmignore file
# Publish to NPM
npm publish

# Users can then install:
npm install -g ontology-lsp
# Or use directly:
npx ontology-lsp init
bunx ontology-lsp start
```
