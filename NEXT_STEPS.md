## ðŸš€ Next Development Priorities

### 1. Fix Remaining Core Test Edge Cases
- **Current**: 140/165 passing (84.8% success rate)
- **Target**: 95% success rate (157/165)
- **Remaining Issues**:
  - Enhanced search async tests (4 failures) - cache eviction logic
  - LSP server integration tests (2 failures) - custom ontology requests
  - Performance/benchmark tests - Layer 1 timeouts with ripgrep
  - Storage path configuration issues in storage.ts
- **Actions**:
  - Fix async cache eviction and TTL handling
  - Add custom ontology request handlers
  - Optimize Layer 1 ripgrep performance
  - Fix storage.ts path configuration

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Layer 1 Search**: Optimize ripgrep timeout issues
- **Cache Strategy**: Improve cache eviction algorithms
- **Memory Usage**: Profile and optimize memory consumption
- **Startup Time**: Reduce cold start latency

### 4. Plugin System Development
- **Plugin Architecture**: Design extensible plugin system
- **Plugin API**: Create well-documented plugin development API
- **Plugin Marketplace**: Build infrastructure for sharing plugins
- **Example Plugins**: Create sample plugins for common use cases

### 5. Advanced Features
- **AI Model Integration**: Connect to local LLMs for enhanced suggestions
- **Multi-Language Support**: Extend beyond TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Incremental Analysis**: Implement file-watching with incremental updates
- **Distributed Architecture**: Enable multi-node deployment for large teams

## ðŸ“Š Technical Debt to Address

### Testing Improvements
- Fix remaining core test edge cases (25 failures, mostly performance/async related)
- Add VS Code test environment support (currently missing vscode package) 
- Add end-to-end integration tests
- Improve test expectation alignment for sub-millisecond operations

### Code Quality
- Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Implement strict TypeScript checks
- Add pre-commit hooks for quality checks
- Set up automated code review tools

### Infrastructure
- Set up production monitoring with Grafana
- Implement log aggregation with ELK stack
- Add distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Create automated backup strategies

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Wins (Can Do Now)

### 1. Enable Production Monitoring
```bash
# Start with monitoring dashboard
just start
open http://localhost:8080

# Check system health
just health-check
```

### 2. Run Full Test Suite
```bash
# Validate everything is working
bun test

# Run specific test categories
bun test tests/adapters.test.ts  # Should be 100% passing
bun test tests/unified-core.test.ts  # ~74% passing
```

### 3. Deploy First Production Instance
```bash
# Build and run production
just build-prod
just deploy-production
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics to Track

Once deployed, monitor these KPIs:
- **Response Time**: Maintain <100ms for 95% of requests
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Target >90% after warm-up
- **Pattern Learning Rate**: Track patterns/day
- **User Adoption**: Monitor active users and usage patterns
- **Error Rate**: Keep below 0.1%
- **Memory Usage**: Stay under 1GB for typical workloads

## ðŸ”— Resources

- **Documentation**: docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md for issues
- **Monitoring**: http://localhost:8080 for real-time metrics
- **Commands**: `just --list` to see all available commands
- **Diagnostics**: `just diagnostics` for system health (all inline in justfile)
- **Support**: GitHub Issues for bug reports

## âœ¨ Vision Alignment

Remember the core vision:
- **Your Code's Living Memory**: Continue building the learning system
- **One Brain, Many Interfaces**: Keep the core protocol-agnostic
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Maintain layer performance targets
- **Learning-First**: Every interaction should teach the system

The foundation is solid. Now it's time to scale and enhance! ðŸš€
