## Memory Architecture Deep Dive

### Cache Service Analysis
**File:** `src/core/services/cache-service.ts`

**Current Implementation:**
- LRU-based memory cache with size estimation
- TTL-based expiration
- Redis support (not yet implemented)
- Configurable max size and memory limits

**Memory Optimization Opportunities:**
1. Size estimation could be more accurate
2. Cache eviction could be more aggressive
3. Memory usage tracking could be improved

### Smart Cache Analysis
**File:** `src/layers/smart-cache.ts`

**Current Implementation:**
- File-aware caching with modification time checking
- Multiple cache zones with different TTLs
- File watchers for invalidation
- Sophisticated dependency tracking

**Memory Concerns:**
1. File watchers could accumulate over time
2. Large dependency arrays could consume memory
3. File content hashing for large files (>1MB limited)

**Positive Aspects:**
- Good cleanup routines (every minute)
- Watcher count limits (max 100)
- Smart eviction based on LRU and memory limits

### Database Service Analysis
**File:** `src/core/services/database-service.ts`

**Current Implementation:**
- Connection pool with max 10 connections by default
- Bun's native SQLite (no external dependencies)
- WAL mode enabled for better performance
- Comprehensive schema with proper indexing

**Memory Efficiency:**
- Very good: Only 528 KB database size
- Connection pooling prevents memory leaks
- Proper cleanup and disposal methods

## Performance Layer Analysis

### Tree-sitter Layer
**Memory Impact:** Medium
- Parser instances cached per language
- AST trees cached with timestamps
- Query objects compiled and cached
- **Optimization:** Could implement AST tree size limits

### Enhanced Search Tools
**Memory Impact:** Low to Medium
- Async implementation with streaming
- Process pool limits (4 processes max)
- Result streaming prevents large memory accumulation
- **Positive:** Good design for memory efficiency

## Optimization Recommendations

### Priority 1: High Impact, Low Effort

1. **Reduce Development Processes**
   ```bash
   # Current: 7 processes
   # Recommendation: 3 processes maximum
   # - 1 HTTP API server
   # - 1 MCP server
   # - 1 MCP HTTP server
   ```
   **Expected Savings:** ~300 MB

2. **Implement Cache Size Monitoring**
   ```typescript
   // Add to cache-service.ts
   private currentMemoryUsage(): number {
     return Array.from(this.cache.values())
       .reduce((total, entry) => total + entry.size, 0);
   }
   ```

3. **Add Memory Alerts**
   ```typescript
   // Alert when memory usage exceeds thresholds
   if (this.currentMemoryUsage() > this.config.maxMemory * 0.8) {
     this.eventBus.emit('cache-service:memory-warning', {
       currentUsage: this.currentMemoryUsage(),
       threshold: this.config.maxMemory * 0.8
     });
   }
   ```

### Priority 2: Medium Impact, Medium Effort

4. **Optimize Tree-sitter Cache**
   - Implement maximum AST tree size limits
   - Add periodic cleanup of unused parsers
   - Limit cache size based on available memory

5. **Enhance Smart Cache Memory Management**
   ```typescript
   // Implement more aggressive cleanup
   private cleanup(): void {
     // Current: every 60 seconds
     // Recommendation: every 30 seconds with memory-based triggers
   }
   ```

6. **Connection Pool Optimization**
   - Reduce default max connections from 10 to 5
   - Implement connection idle timeout
   - Add connection usage metrics

### Priority 3: Low Impact, High Effort

7. **Implement Memory Pooling**
   - Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
   - Buffer pooling for file operations
   - String interning for repeated identifiers

8. **Advanced Caching Strategies**
   - Implement cache compression for large objects
   - Add cache warming strategies
   - Implement distributed caching (Redis)

### Recommended Monitoring Tools
1. **Process Monitor:** htop, btop
2. **Memory Analysis:** valgrind (for native modules)
3. **Heap Analysis:** Node.js built-in heap dump tools
4. **System Monitoring:** sar, iostat

## Conclusion

The Ontology-LSP system shows **excellent memory efficiency** for its functionality scope. The current memory usage of 607.62 MB across 7 processes is reasonable, but there are clear optimization opportunities:

1. **Immediate Impact:** Reduce concurrent processes (potential 300 MB savings)
2. **System Health:** Implement better monitoring and alerting
3. **Long-term:** Optimize caching strategies and add memory pooling

The system architecture is well-designed for memory efficiency, with good separation of concerns, proper cleanup routines, and reasonable cache sizes. The main concern is the number of concurrent processes in development mode, which can be easily addressed.

**Overall Assessment:** 8.5/10 for memory efficiency with clear path to 9.5/10 with recommended optimizations.
