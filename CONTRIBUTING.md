- Possible implementation approach (if applicable)

### Code Contributions

1. **Find an Issue**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
2. **Discuss**: Comment on the issue to discuss your approach
3. **Branch**: Create a feature branch from `develop`
4. **Implement**: Write your code following our coding standards
5. **Test**: Add tests for your changes
6. **Document**: Update documentation as needed
7. **Commit**: Use conventional commit messages
8. **Push**: Push your changes to your fork
9. **PR**: Open a pull request to the `develop` branch

## Pull Request Process

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout develop
   git merge upstream/develop
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**:

   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub

### PR Requirements

- All tests must pass
- Code must be linted (`bun run lint`)
- Documentation must be updated
- Commit messages follow conventional commits
- PR description clearly explains the changes

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use async/await over promises
- Handle errors appropriately

### File Organization

```

â”œâ”€â”€ layers/          # Processing layers
â”œâ”€â”€ ontology/        # Core ontology engine
â”œâ”€â”€ patterns/        # Pattern learning
â”œâ”€â”€ propagation/     # Knowledge propagation

```

### Commit Messages

Follow the Conventional Commits specification:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `test:` Test additions or fixes
- `chore:` Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Examples:

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all new functions
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Tests

- Test layer interactions
- Test LSP protocol compliance
- Test VS Code extension functionality

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run specific test file
bun test src/ontology/ontology-engine.test.ts

# Run with coverage
bun test --coverage
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Include parameter descriptions and return types
- Add usage examples for complex functions

### README Updates

Update the README when:
- Adding new features
- Changing installation steps
- Modifying configuration options
- Adding new commands

### API Documentation

Document all HTTP API endpoints with:
- Endpoint URL and method

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

We use Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- MAJOR: Breaking changes
- MINOR: New features (backwards compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes

### Release Steps

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a git tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release version 1.0.1"
   ```
4. Push tag to trigger release workflow:
   ```bash
   git push upstream v1.0.1
   ```
