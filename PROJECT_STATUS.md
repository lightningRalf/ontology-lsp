# Ontology LSP - Project Status

## 🔴 Critical Issue: Duplicate Implementation Architecture

We have **TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS** that don't share code:

1. **Original LSP Implementation** (`src/`)
   - ✅ LSP Server works with VS Code
   - ✅ HTTP API on port 7000 (limited endpoints)
   - ✅ Has its own layer implementations
   
2. **MCP Implementation** (`mcp-ontology-server/`)
   - ❌ Duplicate of all layers (not shared!)
   - ❌ Misnamed "LSPClient" (actually HTTP client)
   - ❌ Missing critical methods (`findDefinition`, `findReferences`)
   - ❌ Wrong response format structure

## ✅ What Actually Works

### LSP Server (`src/server.ts`)
- **Status**: WORKING
- Properly implements LSP protocol
- VS Code extension can connect
- Has `onDefinition`, `onReferences` handlers
- Uses original layer implementations

### HTTP API Server (`src/api/http-server.ts`)
- **Status**: PARTIALLY WORKING
- Running on port 7000
- Has `/find` endpoint
- Missing `/definition` and `/references` endpoints
- Used by CLI tool

### VS Code Extension (`vscode-client/`)
- **Status**: BUILT & PACKAGED
- Connects to LSP server via stdio
- Package created: `ontology-lsp-1.0.0.vsix`
- Activation needs testing

## ❌ What's Broken

### MCP Server Integration
- **Status**: FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN
- Duplicate layer implementations
- Can't access LSP server functionality
- TreeSitterLayer calls non-existent methods
- Response format doesn't match expectations
- Tests failing due to architectural issues

### Integration Points
- MCP → LSP: No connection exists
- MCP → HTTP API: Incomplete (missing methods)
- Shared state: None (two separate databases/caches)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why It Happened
1. Started with working LSP server
2. Added MCP support separately
3. Instead of creating adapters, duplicated entire layer stack
4. Named HTTP client "LSPClient" causing confusion
5. Never connected MCP to existing LSP server

### Impact
- **Maintenance**: Every fix must be done twice
- **Consistency**: Same function behaves differently
- **Performance**: Double memory usage, no cache sharing
- **Testing**: Can't test integration properly
- **Evolution**: Can't add features coherently

## 📊 Test Status

### Original System Tests
- Server tests: Unknown (need to run)
- Integration tests: Not comprehensive

### MCP System Tests (`mcp-ontology-server/`)
- Unit tests: Some passing
- Integration tests: FAILING
- Issues:
  - `findDefinition` method doesn't exist
  - Response format wrong
  - File paths undefined
  - Timeouts in ontology layer

## 🎯 What Needs to Happen

### Immediate (Fix the Architecture)
1. **Unify layer implementations** - One set of layers, multiple adapters
2. **Fix misnamed components** - Rename LSPClient to HttpApiClient
3. **Add missing methods** - Implement findDefinition, findReferences
4. **Fix response format** - Match expected structure

### Short-term (Make it Work)
1. **Connect MCP to LSP** - Bridge protocols properly
2. **Share state** - Single database, single cache
3. **Add missing endpoints** - Complete HTTP API
4. **Fix tests** - All should pass

### Long-term (Make it Right)
1. **Protocol-agnostic core** - Business logic separate from transport
2. **Proper adapters** - Thin protocol translation layers
3. **Shared services** - Cache, database, AST parsing
4. **Comprehensive tests** - Cross-protocol validation

## 📝 Configuration & Ports

### Port Allocation
- 7000: HTTP API Server (original)
- 7001: MCP SSE Server
- 7002: Reserved for LSP Server (TCP mode, not implemented)

### Test Ports
- 7010-7012: Test instances
- 7020-7022: Test targets

## 🚫 False Claims to Remove

These were incorrectly marked as "completed" but are actually broken or misleading:

- ~~"MCP Server Integration - COMPLETED"~~ → Broken architecture
- ~~"All tests passing (32/32)"~~ → Many are failing
- ~~"LSP Client with circuit breaker"~~ → It's an HTTP client, misnamed
- ~~"4 layers connected to LSP API"~~ → Duplicate layers, not shared
- ~~"Real integration tests validated"~~ → Can't work with broken architecture

## 📈 Real Progress Made

### What We Learned
- Identified the duplicate implementation problem
- Understood the protocol mismatch issues
- Found the misnamed components
- Discovered the missing integration points

### Actual Working Components
- Original LSP server implementation
- Basic HTTP API (needs expansion)
- VS Code extension package
- Some unit tests

## 🎬 Next Session Priority

```bash
# 1. See the problem clearly:
diff -r src/layers/ mcp-ontology-server/src/layers/

# 2. Understand what's calling what:
grep -r "findDefinition" mcp-ontology-server/

# 3. Start fixing:
# - Rename lsp-client.ts to http-api-client.ts
# - Add missing methods
# - Fix response format
# - Begin unifying layers
```

**Status Summary**: The project has a fundamental architectural flaw (duplicate implementations) that must be fixed before any other progress can be made. The original LSP server works, but the MCP integration was built incorrectly as a parallel system instead of an adapter.
