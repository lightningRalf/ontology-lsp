   - **Clarified Reality**: Claude's tools run LOCALLY on user's machine using ripgrep, not on Claude infrastructure
   - **Created Real Comparison**: All tools (Claude, Enhanced, Native) use the same underlying ripgrep/glob/fs
   - **Honest Performance Assessment**: 
     - Native ripgrep: Fastest at 9-13ms for text search
     - Enhanced Tools: Add 5-10ms overhead for features (caching, metadata)
     - Claude Tools: ~5-10ms overhead for function wrapping
   - **Acknowledged Truth**: We didn't build something "better" than Anthropic, but specialized tools for specific use cases

### 18. **ENHANCED SEARCH TOOLS IMPLEMENTATION** ✅
   - Created `src/layers/enhanced-search-tools.ts` with EnhancedGrep, EnhancedGlob, EnhancedLS
   - Added intelligent caching, permission checking, performance monitoring

## 📅 Session Update (2025-08-25) - Current Session

### 28. **LAYER 4 (PATTERN LEARNER) REGISTRATION FIXED** ✅

     - Better discoverability with `just --list`
     - Faster execution without script overhead
     - Consistent interface for all operations
