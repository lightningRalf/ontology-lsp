## 📅 Latest Updates (2025-08-27)

### ⚡ Layer 1 Race + Cancellation (Performance + Reliability)
- Content fast-path and filename discovery now race under a single Layer 1 budget
- True cancellation: losing ripgrep processes are terminated (both content and file discovery)
- Predictable latency: bounded by a global budget that respects LayerManager’s cutoff

### 🔎 File Discovery Reworked (Glob → Ripgrep)
- Replaced expensive workspace globs with `rg --files` (respects .gitignore)
- Added depth/time/file caps and extended ignores (out, build, tmp, .vscode-test, venv, target)
- Removed mtime sorting I/O storm; discovery is now cheap and bounded

### 🧭 Async‑First Find + Scope Fixes
- `findDefinition` uses async fast‑path first; layered escalation only when needed
- Directory URI resolution fixed (no more searching parent directories)
- Propagate `maxResults` to async search; reduced default async timeouts

### 🖥️ CLI UX Improvements
- New `--json` and `--limit` flags for `find`, `references`, and `explore`
- Concise summary output by default; detailed lists gated behind `--verbose`

### ✅ Targeted Tests
- Added cancellation tests for content search and file listing
- Added budget behavior test for typical definition search

### ✅ Validation
- No glob timeouts logged in references path
- `find` returns promptly via async fast‑path; `explore` aggregates in ~10–50ms on local runs

### 🚩 Outstanding items (up next)
- tests/file-uri-resolution.test.ts: adjust fallback file discovery to prioritize true definitions and/or widen the async fast‑path budget in tests to avoid timeouts under tight constraints.
- Some legacy adapter tests referenced old MCP modules; temporary stubs are in place. We will align them with the unified adapter or migrate/remove legacy references.

### 🧪 Artifacts to review
- `test-output.txt` – full test run logs captured to file
- JUnit (optional): `bun test --reporter=junit --reporter-outfile=report.xml`

### 🔁 Quick reproduction
- Focused: `bun test test/layer1-*.test.ts test/error-handling.test.ts`
- File-URI tests: `bun test tests/file-uri-resolution.test.ts --bail=1`
- Full suite stop-at-first-failure: `bun test --bail=1`

### ✅ Adapter and URI Stabilization
- MCP error messages aligned with tests (raw message in `.message`)
- MCP invalid tool and empty symbol handled gracefully without retries
- HTTP completions endpoint caching fixed and stabilized
- CLI adapter returns structured arrays for programmatic/test usage
- File-URI resolution: workspace search prefers true declarations; invalid URIs fall back to workspace root
- Symbol locator API added with simple caching for performance tests

### ⚠️ Performance Benchmarks
- One Layer 1 benchmark may flake in constrained environments due to IO/timeouts
- Plan: tune Layer 1 budget or mock FS for deterministic CI results

## 📅 Previous Updates (2025-08-26)

### ✅ Layer 1 Configuration Issue RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Layer 1 was not finding source files, only test files
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete configuration in `createDefaultCoreConfig()` - missing required ClaudeToolsLayer config properties
- **Resolution**: Added complete configuration structure including grep, glob, ls, and caching sections
- **Result**: Layer 1 now successfully finds 84+ matches including the AsyncEnhancedGrep class definition at line 264
- **Verification**: Direct Layer 1 tests confirm source files are being found correctly
- **Note**: MCP path conversion may show absolute paths with `/mnt/wslg/distro/` prefix in WSL environments
