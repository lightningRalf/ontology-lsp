   - `src/core/unified-analyzer.ts` - Single source of truth
   - `src/core/layer-manager.ts` - Manages all 5 layers
   - `src/core/services/` - Shared services for all protocols

3. **Implemented Thin Protocol Adapters** ✅
   - `src/adapters/lsp-adapter.ts` - 298 lines (was 600+)
   - `src/adapters/mcp-adapter.ts` - 286 lines (was 400+)
   - `src/adapters/http-adapter.ts` - 415 lines (was 700+)
